     * comments whose content is the function's own name — the kind of noise that review policy
     * already rejects. What a function documents about itself stays a review decision.
     *
     * A package entrypoint does carry a one-line summary, because that is what a reader opening the
     * package sees, but nothing enforces it: the only rule that could (`require-file-overview`)
     * wants a `@file` tag, which would be the only TSDoc tag in the codebase, added for a linter
     * rather than for a reader. The canonical description of what each package is for lives in
     * `docs/architecture.md`.
