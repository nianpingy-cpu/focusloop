# Testing

## Commands

```bash
pnpm test                                       # every unit test in the workspace
pnpm --filter @focusloop/learning-state test    # one package
pnpm --filter @focusloop/desktop-e2e run e2e    # the golden path, in the real app
pnpm verify:scaffolding                         # no scaffolding, debug leftovers or bare TODOs
pnpm verify:workflows                           # pinned actions, stated permissions, timeouts
pnpm verify:docs                                # the commands, packages and links the docs cite
pnpm verify:tokens                              # one palette, and the native window background
```

For UI work there is a capture helper that drives the real app through the golden path and writes a
PNG per screen to `demo-ui-review/` **beside** the repository — screenshots are a review aid, not
source, so they are not committed:

```bash
pnpm --filter @focusloop/desktop run build
node apps/desktop-e2e/capture-ui.mjs
```

It is a review aid, not a test: nothing asserts on the images.

`pnpm test` is the fast loop and must stay under a few seconds per package. It deliberately does
**not** run Playwright: `apps/desktop-e2e` has only an `e2e` target, so the E2E suite cannot be
pulled into the unit run by accident. `pnpm e2e` is the slow loop — it builds the desktop app as a
dependency, launches Electron and drives the real UI.

## Hermetic launch

Every Electron process the suite and its helper scripts start (`golden-path.spec.ts`,
`capture-ui.mjs`, `monitor-ui.mjs`, `probe-material.mjs`) builds its child environment with
`hermeticEnv()` in `apps/desktop-e2e/hermetic-env.mjs`: `process.env` passes through so PATH and
DISPLAY survive, and provider credentials are deleted. Without that, a developer machine that
exports `FOCUSLOOP_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` would run the golden path against the real provider — spending
the key on tests and making the offline claim untestable where it matters. CI is inert only because
the secret is absent there, by accident rather than by design.

The first e2e test asserts the run-mode indicator reports the mock provider in offline mode, so a
credential that leaks back into the launch env fails the suite instead of quietly invalidating the
claim. Future provider credentials join the `PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS` list in that one module; that is
the only place the suite decides what a child process may not see.

Nothing in the suite reaches a network provider. The DeepSeek adapter is tested against an injected
`fetch` (see "What is intentionally not tested"), and production only constructs it when a key is
present — which `hermeticEnv()` guarantees it is not.

## The pyramid, and why it is shaped this way

```text
        ▲  E2E (Playwright)
       ╱ ╲   the product, launched and clicked
      ╱   ╲
     ╱     ╲  Integration (agent-core)
    ╱       ╲ the golden path with a real database, in memory
   ╱         ╲
  ╱___________╲ Unit (domain packages)
                the rules, with no IO at all
```

Counts are deliberately absent from this document. `pnpm test` prints its own totals, and a number
quoted in prose is a promise nobody renews: ten tests added to `apps/desktop` in one afternoon were
enough to make three of them wrong. What matters here is _where_ a behaviour is proven, not how many
assertions it took.

Almost everything is a unit test, because almost everything is a pure function. The E2E layer only
has to prove that the pieces are wired together — it does not re-prove the rules.

## Where each behaviour is proven

### `learning-state`

- Every transition, in both directions, including the ones that must _not_ happen.
- Threshold behaviour, including the boundary (a value exactly at the threshold counts).
- Duplicate event ids are ignored; the dedupe ring stays bounded.
- The reducer never mutates its input, and is deterministic for identical input.
- Configuration validation rejects negative and non-finite thresholds.

### `continuity`

- `describeProgress` splits concepts into mastered and unresolved correctly, including partial work.
- Checkpoint content for a fresh session, a mid-task session, a completed session, and a session
  interrupted mid-task.
- Checkpoint ids are stable, so checkpoint creation is idempotent.
- Resume card content, including the "no interruption event present" path.
- `computeResumeLatencyMs` returns `null` for a missing, invalid or skewed timestamp.
- Interruption detection matching already-interrupted state without re-deriving it.

### `intervention-policy`

- `NO_ACTION` for every state that should be left alone.
- Every action rule, including the escalation from `HINT` to `EXAMPLE`.
- The session budget, the cooldown, escalation through the cooldown, and back-off after a dismissed
  resume.
- `RESUME` is never rate limited.
- Outcome recording, per-action aggregation, average latency that ignores non-finite values, and an
  acceptance rate that excludes `NO_ACTION`.

### `persistence`

- Migrations are idempotent.
- Course, concept, task and quiz round-trips; `saveCourse` replaces children rather than duplicating.
- Two courses may share a concept id without colliding (the composite-key regression).
- Material dedupe by content hash.
- Session round-trip preserves the engine state.
- Events are append-only, ordered, counted, and duplicate ids are rejected.
- Checkpoints, outcomes and resume timings round-trip, including `null` latency.
- A file-backed database survives close and reopen.
- Sessions are isolated from one another.

### `agent-core`

- The demo course has the shape the golden path needs.
- Material import is idempotent per content hash.
- Session lifecycle, progress, and dashboard aggregation.
- `getCurrentSession` reports the running session and only the running session: a finished one is
  not current, which is what stops the workspace and the home page from treating it as live.
- Starting a session ends the running one first, so at most one session is ever active — asserted
  through the observable consequence, that ending the running session leaves nothing current.
- An unknown course is rejected before anything is ended, so a bad request cannot cost the learner
  the session they are in.
- The full interruption → checkpoint → resume card → accept → outcome sequence.
- Replayed bridge events are ignored.
- Every policy rule _through the engine_, not just in the policy package.
- Degraded mode: the golden path completes while the provider is unreachable.
- Simulator availability, including the production-disabled path.
- Deterministic micro-task generation: same material in, same course out.

### `apps/desktop`

- IPC validation rejects non-objects, unknown event types, unknown sources, oversize payloads,
  unknown session-end reasons, unknown simulator commands, unsupported locales, and unexpected
  arguments.
- The bridge binds to loopback, rejects a wrong or malformed token, rejects malformed JSON,
  rejects a schema violation, rejects a mismatched protocol version, applies an event id once,
  strips a full URL down to its origin, and reports an error when no session is active.
- The preload and the main process agree on every payload, driven through the shared builders.
- Both language dictionaries define the same key set, cover every key the domain can emit, and use
  the same `{name}` placeholders.
- The document language: `<html lang>` follows the interface locale, so a screen reader is told which
  voice to use.
- The chart helpers the dashboard and the sidebar share: the donut arcs, the heat scale, the span
  formatter, which states count as focus, and which shares are worth drawing at all.
- The event-log folding: adjacent repeats merge, an unrelated event in between does not, two sources
  stay apart, the row is keyed by the oldest event so a new one does not re-key it, and the input
  array is left alone.
- The modal focus arithmetic: Tab and Shift+Tab wrap at both ends, focus entering the dialog from the
  container lands on the right control, and a dialog with no controls reports nothing to do.
- The session plan geometry: block heights are proportional to the estimates, the floor keeps a
  two-minute task readable, the blocks tile the column with no gap or overlap, a negative estimate
  counts as nothing, and every kind has its own glyph.
- The focus timer state machine: the three-minute default, a late tick reporting `expired` and
  never negative time, a paused timer ignoring every further tick, resume continuing from the new
  timestamp with the same remaining time, `+1 minute` preserving elapsed progress, an expired timer
  reopening when a minute is added, zero and negative commitments, immutability, and the `m:ss`
  formatting including the 61-minute case.

### `apps/extension`

- The tracker adopts the first tab, emits left/return with a measured duration, does not double
  emit, and never exposes anything but ids.
- The client queues while disconnected, flushes on connect, keeps a stable id per emission, sends a
  closed payload shape, reconnects after a close, bounds the offline queue, and survives a socket
  factory that throws.

### `apps/desktop-e2e`

The golden path, in the real application:

```text
launch (hermetic env: no provider key) → assert offline mock indicator
      → demo course → start session → start task → complete task
      → simulate distraction → simulate return → INTERRUPTED
      → resume card visible → Continue → RESUMING
      → dashboard shows 1 interruption and a measured resume latency
```

Plus: the agent offers a break on overload and the learner can decline it, the resume card is the
only surface that offers `RESUME`, the sidebar's ambient summary refreshes on a new event without
changing the window the dashboard is showing, three identical events from one click collapse into a
single `×3` row, the remaining work renders as contiguous blocks whose heights differ with the
estimates, the resume card takes focus and keeps it inside itself until Escape closes it, ending a
session leaves the app with nothing current, and the interface can be switched to Chinese with the
choice surviving a real restart of the app.

There is no `test` target for this project on purpose. When there was one it ran Playwright under
`pnpm test`, which meant the unit run tried to launch Electron without a build — CI could never go
green.

## Conventions

- Test files live next to the code as `*.spec.ts`.
- Test names describe behaviour, not implementation: `it('moves to INTERRUPTED when the learner
returns after the threshold')`, not `it('tests reduceState')`.
- Fixtures live in `fixtures.ts` and are excluded from the build output.
- Time is always injected. There is no `Date.now()` and no `Math.random()` in a domain package.
- A regression test names the bug it prevents.

## What is intentionally not tested

- Angular component rendering. The renderer holds no decisions; the E2E test covers the wiring that
  matters.
- Electron's own behaviour.
- Anything requiring the network. The DeepSeek adapter is tested against an injected `fetch`, so its
  status mapping, timeout, and key handling are proven without a single real request. The e2e suite
  never has a key to use: see "Hermetic launch".
