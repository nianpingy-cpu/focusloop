# Privacy

FocusLoop exists to help people who find it hard to start and resume work. It is built on the
assumption that such a tool is only usable if it is obviously, verifiably private.

## The short version

- No account. No sign-in. No telemetry. No analytics. No crash reporting. No ads.
- No central server. There is nothing to send data to.
- Everything is stored in one SQLite file in your OS user-data directory.
- The optional model provider is off unless you supply a key yourself.
- The browser extension cannot read page content, because it does not request permission to.

### Decision: option (A) — no production telemetry

**Chosen and frozen** (issue [#115](https://github.com/nianpingy-cpu/focusloop/issues/115), 2026-09-25):

The product ships with **no telemetry of any kind** — no aggregate metrics, no analytics, no crash
reports. Evaluation and guardrail reports (AG10) are produced **only on developer machines and in
CI**; the running application never uploads them.

**Option (B) — allowing aggregate metrics later — is rejected until this document is amended first.**
Any future change must specify, before any code ships: default on/off; how consent is obtained and
withdrawn; the destination; retention period; how a user deletes what was already sent; and a
field-level allowlist of what can **never** be uploaded (raw material, learner text, tutor
transcripts, provider prompts, keys, URLs, form content). A consent UI and deletion path must land
in the same change as the weakened promise.

Until that happens, any wiki or plan text that suggests production upload is wrong and must be
removed, not footnoted.

## What FocusLoop stores

| Data                                    | Where        | Why                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Courses, concepts, micro tasks, quizzes | local SQLite | to run a session                     |
| Imported material                       | local SQLite | to generate micro tasks              |
| Sessions, learning events               | local SQLite | to compute the learning state        |
| Checkpoints                             | local SQLite | to resume your cognitive position    |
| Interventions and outcomes              | local SQLite | to show whether help actually helped |
| Resume-card timings                     | local SQLite | to measure resume latency            |

The database lives at:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\FocusLoop\focusloop.sqlite`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/FocusLoop/focusloop.sqlite`
- Linux: `~/.config/FocusLoop/focusloop.sqlite`

Deleting that file removes everything FocusLoop knows. Uninstalling leaves it in place on purpose,
so a reinstall does not lose your progress.

## What FocusLoop never collects

- No page content, no page titles, no URLs.
- No keystrokes, no form values, no clipboard.
- No cookies, no browsing history, no bookmarks.
- No camera, no microphone, no eye tracking, no screen recording.
- No device fingerprints, no location, no contacts.

## The browser bridge

The extension is optional. The golden path works without it, via the Demo Event Simulator.

What it does collect: **tab activation and idle state only** — "the active tab changed", "the user
became idle", "the user came back after 30 seconds".

Why it _cannot_ collect more:

```json
{ "permissions": ["idle", "storage", "alarms"] }
```

There is no `tabs` permission and no host permission, so the extension API will not return a URL or
a title even if the code asked for one. There are no content scripts, so nothing runs inside a page.
The tracker's entire state is `{ learningTabId, awaySince, idleSince }` — three numbers and an id.

Transport is equally constrained:

- The desktop binds a WebSocket server to **`127.0.0.1` only**. It is not reachable from the network.
- Every message must carry a **per-run token**, compared in constant time. The token is regenerated
  each launch and shown to you in the app so you can paste it into the extension.
- Every message is **schema-validated**. Unknown fields are dropped, an oversized message is
  rejected, and a message that is not on the closed list of types is refused.
- If `payload.origin` is present it is reduced to `scheme://host`. A path, query or fragment never
  survives validation.
- Event ids are remembered in a bounded ring, so a reconnect cannot replay an event.

## When a model provider is used

FocusLoop ships with `MockAIProvider`: deterministic, offline, no key. It is the default and it is
enough for the entire demo.

If you set `FOCUSLOOP_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, the app will additionally use DeepSeek for optional
enrichment (for example, generating an example for a hint). In that case:

- only the text of the single request is transmitted;
- your learning events, checkpoints, session history and database are **never** sent;
- the key is read from the environment only — it is never written to the repository, never persisted
  to the database, and never included in an error message or a log;
- if the request fails for any reason — offline, timeout, rate limit, bad response — FocusLoop
  silently degrades to the mock provider and tells the UI that it did.

You can verify the second claim by reading `packages/llm-provider/src/deepseek-provider.ts`: the
request body contains exactly `model`, `messages`, `stream` and the sampling options.

## What the app can see, and what it does about it

The renderer is sandboxed with `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false` and
`sandbox: true`. Its only capability is a fixed list of methods on `window.focusloop`. It cannot
read files, open sockets, or spawn processes.

The Content-Security-Policy is:

```text
default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'
```

No remote script, no inline script, no remote connection from the renderer.

## Your rights, practically

- **Access:** the database is a single file you own.
- **Deletion:** delete the file.
- **Portability:** it is standard SQLite; open it with any SQLite client.
- **Refusal:** do not install the extension, and do not set an API key. You lose nothing essential.
