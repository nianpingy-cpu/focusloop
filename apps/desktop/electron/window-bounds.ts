 * what turns "centred" into "on screen". When the position is usable, the size is kept exactly as it was,
 * overhang and all.
 *
 * The clamp is the app's own guarantee rather than the platform's, deliberately: Windows does constrain an
 * oversized window by itself, so removing this changes nothing there and there is no end-to-end test that
 * can tell the difference. Not depending on that is the point - the rule is what makes the invariant
