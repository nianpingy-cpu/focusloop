 * outlive the lazy focus component: destroying that component on `/focus` navigation used to reset
 * an active timer to three minutes. This root service is the smallest boundary that preserves the
 * timer within one renderer lifetime, while `sync` drops it whenever the session or current task
 * changes. Domain state changes such as `HELP_REQUESTED` intentionally do not reset the commitment:
 * the focus page still owns that task and the agent response is rendered alongside it.
