/**
 * What the model is told when it is asked again.
 *
 * Format failures only, so the parameter is narrowed to the retryable subset — passing
 * `unquoted-confirmation` is then a type error rather than a function that politely claims the reply
 * was missing a label.
 *
 * **This is a follow-up turn, not a fresh prompt.** It carries the problem, the format and the
 * question, and deliberately no context block or excerpt: it must be appended after the exchange it is
 * correcting, against the same system prompt, so the model can see the answer it is being asked to
 * redo. Sending it on its own would leave nothing to ground an answer in — which is a fact about how
 * step two has to call it, and is therefore written here rather than assumed there.
 *
 * Four things the caller owns, and must not infer from this function:
 *
 * 1. **At most once per exchange.** `isRetryable` is a predicate, not a budget: it answers "is this the
 *    kind of failure worth asking again about", the same way every time. Nothing here counts.
 * 2. **The retry message is transport, not a transcript turn.** If it were recorded as a learner turn,
 *    the transcript would grow a meta-instruction ("Your answer had no labelled blocks at all") and
 *    every later question in that conversation would carry it. The exchange records the learner's
 *    question and the answer that came back; this is how the second one was obtained.
 * 3. **Do not retry an offline provider.** `MockAIProvider`'s output never parses — there is a test
 *    pinning that — so retrying it is two mock calls and no answer, on every offline question, which
 *    is the golden path. The signal is `provider.offline`, and the guard belongs at the **entry** to the
 *    ask rather than here: an offline provider never reaches a retry, so there is nothing to check at
 *    this point. `TutorProviderInfo.degraded` is the other signal and it is a different state — the
 *    provider was reached and failed, where a retry costs a second call for a second failure.
 * 4. **Do not spend the retry on a question that was never asked.** An empty or all-label message
 *    sanitises to nothing, and this function will then emit no `[question]` block at all — the same
 *    artefact the builder refuses to send. Emitting nothing is the right output and it is not a repair:
 *    the retry exists to get a second answer to a question the learner *did* ask, so a caller that
 *    reaches here with nothing asked has already made the mistake, and a refusal is what it wanted.
 *
 * The sanitiser's own removals are **not reported here**, because this returns a string and has nowhere
 * to put them. That is not a loss in the only call site: the question handed in is the text the builder
 * already sanitised and reported, so there is nothing left to strip. A caller that passes raw text is
 * throwing away an omission it should have produced itself.
