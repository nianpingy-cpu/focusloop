/**
 * The rules the ask adds to the tutor's two halves (AG3 step two).
 *
 * `tutor.ts` decides what to send and whether what came back is an answer. This decides the three
 * things that are about the *conversation* rather than one exchange: where the transcript lives and
 * what it keeps, what the learner is told when there is no answer, and what the inspector is told
 * about a prompt that was built and never sent. Kept pure and out of `engine.ts` for the reason every
 * other rule in this package is: the engine wires, and the wiring is not testable without a database.
 *
 * The transcript is the reason this module exists at all. It becomes text the model reads as its own
 * prior output, so it is the largest untrusted string in the feature, and the renderer must neither
 * supply it nor be able to read it back into a prompt. It is kept here, in the main process, keyed by
 * session, and the only thing that ever crosses the bridge is the learner's current question.
 *
 * **Its length is the caller's bound, not this module's.** `record` clips on write — a question to
 * `questionCharacters` and an answer to `answerCharacters` — but nothing here stops a caller handing
 * `list()` straight to `buildTutorPrompt`, which clips every turn to `answerCharacters` again and is
 * where the bound that reaches the model is enforced. For a learner turn that is a real reduction (2,000
 * down to 600); for a tutor turn, already stored at the same bound, it is a no-op. Said because the two
 * are easy to read as one guarantee, and only the second one is kept.

/**
 * The follow-up turn that asks for the answer again, and the bound `tutor.ts` cannot enforce.
 *
 * `buildTutorRetryPrompt` writes the complaint and says, in its own doc, that the caller appends it
 * after the exchange it is correcting and against the same system prompt. It cannot bound the result:
 * it does not see what it is being appended to, and the whole thing together is a prompt that was
 * already budgeted plus a turn that was never budgeted. **A retry is a second call, and a second call
 * over the ceiling is the same defect as a first one over the ceiling** — so the composition, and its
 * bound, live here, where both halves are visible.
 *
 * **It composes from the preamble — everything before the question — and not from the prompt.** The
 * first version took the prompt whole, which carries the `[question]` block, and appended the retry,
 * which restates the question: the question was sent twice, and the duplicate is what the ceiling could
 * not afford. Measured at the constants as they stand, a 2,000-character question, an echoed answer at
 * `answerCharacters` and the complaint together come to more than the ceiling — the preamble and the
 * question each fit on their own, so the duplicate is what tips it — and the repair was therefore
 * available only to learners who wrote *short* questions.
 *
 * The model's own first answer is included, because the doc says the retry has to let the model see the
 * answer it is being asked to redo, and it is clipped to `TUTOR_LIMITS.answerCharacters` for the same
 * reason a stored answer is: it is model prose of unknown length and the budget is not.
 *
 * **Refusing is a real outcome, not an error.** When it does not fit, the retry is not sent and the
 * caller reports why: a second call that would break the ceiling is worse than no second call, and a
 * silent skip would be the reader's `recovered` parts disappearing with no explanation. It is reachable
 * — a full transcript plus both context fields at their caps leaves no room — and it is the honest
 * answer in that state rather than a defect to be designed away.
 *
 * **The size comes back with the prompt.** The caller reports what was sent, and deriving that from
 * `prompt.length + system.length` a second time would be a second transcription of the one number this
 * function already computed to make its own decision — the same defect the `ASSEMBLY_JOIN` doc names, one
 * layer up. The number reported is the number that was checked, by construction.
