/**
 * What the agent is allowed to know about the current moment.
 *
 * The point of this type is its **boundaries**, not its fields. Handing a model the course list, the
 * session log and the database is easy to write and impossible to keep honest: the prompt grows with
 * the learner's history, the cost stops being predictable, and nothing states what the model may see.
 *
 * What this file actually guarantees, precisely: every field is either bounded by a limit named in
 * `AGENT_CONTEXT_LIMITS` or is a single record, and every exclusion is itemised in
 * `AgentContextOmission` rather than silently dropped. What it does **not** guarantee is the input —
 * the source is assembled by the caller, so this describes the shape of what is handed over, not the
 * policy for choosing it.
 *
 * The checkpoint is the one field passed through whole. It is already a summary of where the learner
 * got to, and trimming it would damage the thing the resume capability exists to restore. It is named
 * here rather than left implicit, because "everything is bounded" would otherwise be a claim this
 * file does not make good on.
 *
 * A note on naming: the design notes call the checkpoint a `CognitiveCheckpoint`. The continuity
 * package already stores exactly that object as `LearningCheckpoint`, so this reuses it. Two names
 * for one thing is how a domain drifts.
